## FAST String Manipulation


</div>

### Description

When this module is compiled to native code, you can use the ReplaceString, InString, InStringRev, StrReverse, TrimStr, RTrimStr, LTrimStr, StringReplicate, JoinString and SplitString functions to be many times faster and much more memory effecient than their VB counterparts. Many are more functional as well. The replacestring function supports delimiters and prefix/postfix exclusions. All of these functions are fully unicode compliant. The performance gain becomes greater with extremely long strings, where most of the functions take less than 2% of the time and half the memory that the same call would take with intrinsic functions. By the way, you can all stop telling me that xbeat.net/vbspeed has faster code. They did have faster code than my first version, but not any of the other ones. See for yourself, the test specifications are on their website. :)
